Revision history for Perl extension Makefile::Parser.

0.09 10/15/2005
	- Fix a stupid bug in Parser.pm. The order of the two suffixes is
	  inverted accidentally.
	- Update the POD document, implementation, and tests accordingly.

0.08 10/10/2005
        - Make Makefile::Parser->parse to raise syntax errors under strict mode
        - Add full support for implicit pattern rules:
            %.o : %.c
                $(CC) -c $<
          The order of the implicit rules is not significant. Whee!
        - Add more tests for pattern rules, expand $< and $* as expected, and clean up
          the stderr output.
        - Add support for implicit suffix rules:
            .c.o:
		$(CC) -c $<
	  Currently .SUFFIXES is a no-op. So suffix rules will be applied to any 
	  suffix-like targets.
	  Internally the parser converts the suffix rules to pattern
	  rules, thus saving me a lot of coding.

0.07 10/5/2005
        - Host this module to a SVN repository at OSSF
        - Add sections "Syntax Supported" and "TODO" to POD doc

0.06 10/5/2005
        - Add string-ify overloading to the Makefile::Target class
        - Use tar+gzip to compress the distribution.

0.05 10/1/2005
        - Add support for the syntax ^\

0.04 9/30/2005
        - Fix some issues in the POD doc

0.03 9/30/2005
        - Force the user to call the ->parse method after he/she constructs every Makefile::Parser object.
          That is to say, the constructor of the Makefile::Parser class won't call ->parse internally
          from now on.
        - Add error checking code and corresponding tests for Parser objects which has never parsed anything.
        - Add support of default target to the ->target method of the Makefile::Parser class.
        - Add method ->roots to the Makefile::Parser class which returns the "root targets" for the
          Makefile.
        - Use Devel::Cover to check the code coverage.
        - Use Test::Pod to check the validity of the POD docs
        - Use Test::Pod::Coverage to check the integrity of POD docs

0.02 9/25/2005
        - Fix a bug in the SYNOPSIS of the POD doc.
        - Add many other stuff to the POD doc too.
