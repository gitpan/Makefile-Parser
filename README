Makefile-Parser version 0.11
============================

This is a parser for Makefiles. At this very early stage, the parser
only support a very limited set of features, so it may not do what
you expected it to do. Currently its main purpose is to provide basic
support for another module named GraphViz::Make, which is aimed
to render the buiding processes specified by a Makefile using
the amazing GraphViz library. The Make module is not satisfactory
for this purpose, so I decided to build one of my own.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Test::More (for testing purpose only)
